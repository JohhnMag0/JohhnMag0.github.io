      <description>Compiling the Linux Kernel  Introduction Preparing the environment Compiling  1. Introduction In the last few months, programming aimed at more obscure areas of computers has piqued my interest.And it was through these studies that I discovered the field of kernel development, and there is no better place to study kernel than the Linux kernel itself.

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s All Binaries Automatons Roll Out Compiling Flexing my Bison with a Calculator  1.Introduction When we think of computers, particularly programming languages, one of the first questions that should come to mind is, &amp;ldquo;How does the computer understand that?&amp;ldquo;And that is one of the questions that can be answered by analyzing how a compiler works.
Compilers are basically programs that can translate programming languages into computer language. And that is what we are going to talk about in this article.</description>

      <description>Vim or How do I exit this sh@#?  Introduction A Brief History of VIM VIMtutor Useful Commands Plug-In and .vimrc  1.Introduction If you came here because of the title, I will just answer you in the spot :wq if you want to save before leaving, or :q! if you just want to exit without saving. If that was all that you need to know and you really didn&amp;rsquo;t like how difficult it was to use vim I can&amp;rsquo;t hold you in this article anymore.</description>

      <description>Generating Random Passwords  Introduction Why Computers can&amp;rsquo;t Generate Random Numbers? /dev/urandom and /dev/random Implementing a CLI on Linux  1.Introduction I have been taking some classes at the university these last few weeks, and we started to get a grasp on the C programming language, and I really like the idea of seeing how things work under the hood. But I really think that the best way to see if you are really getting somewhere is to make some projects, and one of the things that I consider very useful but we don&amp;rsquo;t have that by default on Linux is a random password generator, so I decided to create a simple CLI program that does exactly that generates random passwords.</description>

      <description>Introduction What is the OTP? URI Format Enconding with Base32 Generating a QRCode  1.Introduction For the last month, I have been working on a library for PHP that will implement the OTP(One Time Password) in an easy way. In the following topics, I will try to explain each technology and protocol that were used to build this software. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pass for this technical stuff, you can just go to the explanation of the library.</description>

      <description>I know that right in the first page you get all that talk about getting insides and all that, but before we get in all that stuff I think I need to address the fact that a lot of people will look to this blog and thing &amp;ldquo;well that&amp;rsquo;s just sh&amp;amp;@$&amp;rdquo;, and I know that I&amp;rsquo;m not very good a desing myself.
But something too fancy would destroy the idea of this site.</description>
