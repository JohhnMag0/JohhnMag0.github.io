As you may be aware, it is common practice in the software industry to attribute some kind of license to work, not because we like to read law books, but because there is always someone who will steal your work and not give the proper credit for data (I'm looking at you, copilot).So furthermore, I'm using Creative Commons International 4.0(CC 4.0), and with that license, you that are reading this blog are free to:

- Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.

- Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially. 

While you can enjoy this work, you also have some obligations, such as:

- Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. 

- No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

For the full text of the license, you can go to https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode

Basically, with this license, you can use everything that I wrote here for your own purpose. Just give me some credit for it and don't change the license. And I have to say, if someone is using my work to burn people alive (or some other kind of spooky thing), I have nothing to do with that.

And always remember kids open source is always better than close source.
