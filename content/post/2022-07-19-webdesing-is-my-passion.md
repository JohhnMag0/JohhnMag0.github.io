I know that right in the first page you get all that talk about getting insides and all that, but before we get in all that stuff I think I need to address the fact that a lot of people will look to this blog and thing "well that's just sh&@$", and I know that I'm not very good a desing myself.

But something too fancy would destroy the idea of this site. This blog is made with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), and for the theme I used [hugo-classic](https://github.com/goodroot/hugo-classic). I know most people won't like the style of this site, but the idea of this blog is to make something that resembles a book or a journal where everything is static. That's why I use HUGO and not wordpress, the experience that I want you to have is the same experience as when you read a book ~~something boring as f@&~~ something that doesn't distract you and permit you to focus on what is important the idea that is being passed in the article.

So if someone happens to stop by your side and mock you by saing "What's that you reading some 80's blog?", you can turn around and say "Yeah actually it's and you know what is because this type of atitude that your wife left you Jerry.".

Oh, and I almost forgot, as this is the first post on this blog, I have to say:

### Hello WORLD!
